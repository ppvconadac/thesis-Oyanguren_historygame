  - I got the silk. We're on our way to profit.
  - That's good news. But really, you shouldn't be too reckless.
  - I can't help it I guess. An adventurer's blood flows through these veins.
  - Still, you be careful. Anyway, I too have news for you.
  - You've mentioned to me before, how you've studied law.
  - Well, word is a law school just opened in Manila, figured you'd be interested.
  - Hmmmm..
  - So, what do you think?

  - Jose, there's a storm up ahead.. I advise we drop the anchor and dock.
  - Yes, I agree. Let's go to the nearest island. We'll wait the storm out there.
  - Might as well resupply and find more men while we're at it.
  - All right.

  - In 1835, the University of Santo Tomas opened its Law Department.
  - With that, Oyanguren sailed for Manila to complete the degree he began at the
    Colegio Real Universidad de Bergara in Spain.
  - In August 5,1837 he obtaind his Bachiller en Leyes.
  - He then held a position of judge in Tondo, Manila from 1839 to 1844, before eventually
    being relieved to give way to a Madrid appointee.
  - Thus, he pursued his business ventures in Caraga, and it was there when he met
    his lover, Maria Luisa Azaola.
  - She was a Spanish lady whose family had a plantantion.
  - She also had a brother, Antonio, who traded around the Gulf of Davao.
  - Antonio was part of the San Rufo incident in 1844.
  - The ship San Rufo was anchored of the coast of Malipano on Samal Island. Her captian
    had presented a letter of introduction to the Moros there.
  - The letter, from Datu Iskandar Quadratullah, Sultan of Maguindanao asked the Moros
    to receive the traders in peace.
  - However, the Moros under the guise of trade killed everyone aside from two servants.
    These two would later escape to tell the story of the treachery.
  - The incident caused an outrage in Manila.. Thus, looking for answers, the Spaniards
    confronted Datu Quadratullah, but he disclabied all responsibility.
  - The Datu disowned the Moros who disobeyed his orders, and left Spain to deal with
    them. The Spaniards had now fredom of action against the Moros in the gulf of
    Davao.
  - It did not take long for Don Jose to organize an expedition. He approached businessmen
    to finance the project and presented his proposal to Governor General Claveria.
  - Soon enough, Claveria granted Don Jose's mission on February 27, 1847. His mission,
    to conquer and subdue all Moros in the entire gulf area.
  - Don Jose was provided with soliders, artillery, firearms and three gunships.
  - Attracted by the promise of new territory, many adventuresome natives from different
    areas in the Philippines also supplemented the crew.
  - The expedition set sail for Mindanao on April 1848.
